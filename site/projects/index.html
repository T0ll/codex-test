    <h2>Hotel Website (2021 - link coming soon)</h2>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
    This project consists in developing a website to manage the hotel rooms booking for a friend's family hotel. While working on this project I was preparing for my AWS Certified Cloud Solutions Architect certification. I used this project as an opportunity to practice my skills by setting up a full web solution. The solution so far consists in a Two-tier web architecture leveraging Roomify (a Drupal distribution), EC2 (On-Demand AWS instances) and also RDS (Managed AWS relational database). I am following AWS Well-Architected Framework to achieve performance efficiency while keeping costs low. The system must be able to handle a reasonable amount of traffic without slowing down and to achieve good standards of security.

    <h2>Faguo Huangjia, Tourism Agency Showcase Website (2020 - link coming soon)</h2>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
    This project consists in building a website to showcase the services offered by a friend's tourism agency specialized in French-Chinese tourism agency. The agency already has a website for Chinese clients hosted on a Chinese server. With the 2020 tourism decrease due to the COVID crisis, the agency needed a similar website tailored for its European based clients. This project was built using the AWS LightSail service of Amazon to create a Wordpress server hosted on an EC2 on-demand instance and using a RDS managed database. It was also an opportunity for me to apply user design principles by conducting sessions with users to understand the features needed for this solution.

    <h2>Secu Synchro, Health care data quality script (2019)</h2>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
    A friend of mine working as an independent midwife in France was seeing 50% of her requests for payment rejected by Social Security for treatments she provided. As the approval system was a blackbox, there was no indication of why the requests for payments were rejected, leading to a lot of trials and errors. I created a R script which matched her agenda and the Social Security response and highlighted which one were rejected. Then it ran some common checks to understand what was wrong. Most common patterns were social security numbers and name mismatch. Through this approach we reduced to 20% the rejection rate leading to better cash flow in her business.

    <h2>Storysake, an Alzheimer's disease treatment startup (2016)</h2>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
    As a member of the Imperial College Data Science Society, me and a group of classmates joined the Angelhack Hackathon London in 2016. During this weekend long hackathon, we built a platform to help people suffering from Alzheimer's disease through Reminiscence Therapy. The website leveraged HPE Haven API for speech and image recognition. We won first place at the hackathon and worked three months on a prototype as part of the Angelhack Accelerator. During this period, I industrialized our prototype within the AWS infrastructure to improve scalability and decrease our costs. In the end, our team decided that it was not a good time for us in our career to pursue this project.
